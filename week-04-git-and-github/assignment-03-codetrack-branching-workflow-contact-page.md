# Assignment 3 — CodeTrack: Branching Workflow (Add & Verify a Contact Page)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will add a new Contact page to CodeTrack using a clean feature-branch workflow. You will keep each change in a separate commit, prove that your default branch remains unchanged before the merge, and validate the result after merging.

## Goal

Start from a clean default branch (`main` or `master`) and confirm the repository status.

### Evidence
